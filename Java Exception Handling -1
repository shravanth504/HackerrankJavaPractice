public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        try {
            int y = in.nextInt();
            int z = in.nextInt();
            int r = y/z;
            System.out.print(r);
        }
        catch (InputMismatchException e) {
            System.out.print("java.util.InputMismatchException");
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.print(e);
        }
